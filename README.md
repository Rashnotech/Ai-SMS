AI Enhanced Security Management System

## Overview
This project investigates the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) 
into security management systems to enhance threat detection, response capabilities, 
and overall cybersecurity posture. The primary focus lies in leveraging machine 
learning algorithms and advanced analytics to augment traditional security measures.
Through an exploration of existing literature, case studies, and practical implementations, 
the research seeks to address the growing complexity and sophistication of cyber threats faced 
by organizations. The study aims to identify key research problems such as improving 
anomaly detection, automating incident response, and optimizing security operations through 
AI-driven insights. By proposing a framework for an AI-enhanced security management system, 
incorporating real-time data analysis, anomaly detection, and predictive analytics, 
the study anticipates significant advancements in threat mitigation and risk management. 
The expected findings include enhanced detection accuracy, reduced response times, 
and improved adaptability to evolving threats. The study concludes by highlighting the 
transformative potential of AI in revolutionizing security practices and underscores the 
imperative for organizations to embrace AI technologies as a cornerstone of their 
cybersecurity strategies.
